## Function Transformations

The function **_g_(x) = a&fnof;(x-c) + d** is a transformed function in terms of
the parent function **&fnof;(x)**.

The parameters **a**, **c**, and **d**
transform the function in the following ways:

| Parameter | Transformation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Identify the Transformations

### Identify Transformation One

Given the parent function is **&fnof;(x)**, the transformations used to create
the transformed function **_g_(x)** are:

> **_g_(x) = -2&fnof;(x) + 3**

- Vertical reflection
- Vertical stretch by a factor of 2
- Vertical shift up 3 units

Suppose that **&fnof;(x) = 2&radic;x - 1**. The formula in terms of **_x_**
for each of the functions is:

1. **_g_(x) = -2&fnof;(x) + 3**
2. **_g_(x) = -2(2&radic;x - 1) + 3**
    - You could leave it like this, but it's better to follow the rest of the
      steps for readability.
3. **_g_(x) = -4&radic;x +2 + 3**
4. **_g_(x) = -4&radic;x + 5**

#### Transformation One Image Format

![](assets/function_transformations_001.png)

---

### Identify Transformation Two

Given the parent function is **&fnof;(x)**, the transformations used to create
the transformed function **_k_(x)** are:

> **_k_(x) = 0.5&fnof;(x - 4)**

- Vertical compression by a factor of 0.5
- Horizontal shift to the right 4 units

Suppose that **&fnof;(x) = 2&radic;x - 1**. The formula in terms of **_x_**
for each of the functions is:

1. **_k_(x) = 0.5&fnof;(x - 4)**
2. **_k_(x) = 0.5(2&radic;(x - 4) - 1)**
    - The equation becomes **x - 4** inside the radical, because the input for
      **&fnof;** is **x - 4**, not just **x**.
    - The radical sign goes above both the **x** and the **4**, hence the
      parentheses.
3. **_k_(x) = 1&radic;(x - 4) - 0.5**
4. **_k_(x) = &radic;(x - 4) - 0.5**

#### Transformation Two Image Format

![](assets/function_transformations_002.png)

---

### Identify Transformation Three

Given the parent function is **&fnof;(x)**, the transformations used to create
the transformed function **_j_(x)** are:

> **_j_(x) = -4&fnof;(-x) - 0.5**

- Vertical reflection
- Vertical stretch by a factor of 4
- Horizontal reflection
- Vertical shift down 0.5 units

Suppose that **&fnof;(x) = 2&radic;x - 1**. The formula in terms of **_x_**
for each of the functions is:

1. **_j_(x) = -4(&fnof;(-x) - 0.5)**
2. **_j_(x) = -4(2&radic;-x - 1) - 0.5**
3. **_j_(x) = -8&radic;-x + 4 - 0.5**
4. **_j_(x) = -8&radic;-x + 3.5**

## Identify Graph Transformations

### Identify Graph Transformation One

Suppose we were given the graph of the parent function **&fnof;** and asked to
graph the transformed function:

> **g(x) = 2&fnof;(x — 1)**

<u>The graph:</u>

![](assets/function_transformations_004.png)

- The graph was shifted to the right 1 unit, and stretched vertically by a
  factor of 2.
    - The **x** inputs were shifted to the right 1 unit.
    - The **y** outputs were stretched vertically by a factor of 2.

---

### Identify Graph Transformation Two

Suppose we were given the graph of the parent function **_r_** (in red) and the
transformed function **_b_** (in blue) and asked to identify the
transformations:

![](assets/function_transformations_005.png)

<u>Based on the graph, the formula of **_b_** in terms of **_r_** is:</u>

> **_b_(x) = r(x + 3) + 1**

To identify the transformations:

- **Vertical stretch or compression**
    1. Look for a change in outputs from on set of coordinates to the next on
       both graphs. If the parent function increases by 1 unit on both the _x_
       and _y_ axes, but the transformed function increases by more than 1 unit,
       there is either a stretch or compression.
- **Horizontal shift**
    1. Look for how far the transformed function is shifted horizontally from
       the parent function.
- **Vertical shift**
    1. Look for how far the transformed function is shifted vertically from the
       parent function.
- **Vertical reflection**
    1. Look for a change in the vertical direction of the graph.
    2. If the parent function is going one way vertically and the transformed
       function is vertically going the opposite way, there is a vertical
       reflection.
- **Horizontal reflection**
    1. Look for a change in the horizontal direction of the graph.
    2. If the parent function is going one way horizontally and the transformed
       function is horizontally going the opposite way, there is a horizontal
       reflection.

---

### Identify Graph Transformation Three

Suppose we were given the graph of the parent function **_r_** (in red) and the
transformed function **_b_** (in blue) and asked to identify the
transformations:

![](assets/function_transformations_006.png)

<u>Based on the graph, the formula of **_b_** in terms of **_r_** is:</u>

> **_b_(x) = 3r(x + 4)**

To identify the transformations:

- **Vertical stretch**
    1. The parent function increases by 1 unit on both the _x_ and _y_ axes, but
       the transformed function increases by 3 units on the _y_-axis and 1 unit
       on the _x_-axis.
    2. The increase in the transformed function is **3** times more than the
       increase in the parent function.
    3. The parent function starts at **(0, 1)**, but if it were stretched by
       a factor of **3**, then the transformed function would start at **(0, 3)
       **.
        - You can make sure that the predicted stretch is correct by either
          drawing out the graph or by checking the other points and making sure
          that they all align with what the y-values should be. _Use a table if
          necessary_.
    4. It's being stretched by a factor of **3**.
    5. It's also helpful to draw out the stretched graph to make sure that it
       matches the transformed graph.
- **Horizontal shift**
    1. The transformed function is shifted to the left by **4** units.

### Identify Graph Transformation Four

Suppose we were given the graph of the parent function **_r_** (in red) and the
transformed function **_b_** (in blue) and asked to identify the
transformations:

![](assets/function_transformations_007.png)

<u>Based on the graph, the formula of **_b_** in terms of **_r_** is:</u>

> **_b_(x) = -2r(x) + 2**

To identify the transformations:

- **Vertical reflection**
    1. The parent function is going one way vertically and the transformed
       function is vertically going the opposite way, there is a vertical
       reflection.
- **Vertical stretch**
    1. The transformed function decreases at twice the amount of the parent
       function.
- **Vertical shift**
    1. The transformed function is shifted up by **2** units.

## Horizontal Reflections

Suppose that the transformed function **_g_(x)** is:

> **_g_(x) = &fnof;(-x)**

Now suppose that the parent function **&fnof;** is:

> **&fnof;(x) = 4x - 5**

<u>The Result:</u>

## Piecewise Function Definition

A **piecewise function** is a function that is defined in different ways for
different intervals.

## Roadtrip Problem

### Initial Story

> On a recent road trip I traveled through various road conditions
> and weather patterns and so my average speed varied greatly
> throughout the day.
>
> I started the day at my brother’s house in a rural area in northern
> Florida. Because he lives so far from the highway my average
> speed for the first 1.75 hours was only 38 mph. Once I hit the
> highway however I was able to drive faster and hence I averaged
> 76 mph for the next 2.8 hours. Unfortunately, as is often the case
> in Florida, a sudden torrential rainstorm came up and the
> visibility was so bad that for the next 30 minutes I only averaged
> 8 mph! Finally, the rain stopped, but by then I was so tired I
> needed to take a rest, so I pulled off at the next exit and found a
> McDonald’s to sit at and surf the internet for a little while.

### Roadtrip Graph

_This graph represents the roadtrip problem:_

![](assets/roadtrip_graph.png)

### Creating a Function for the Model

There are two options:

1. Create a separate function model per portion of the road trip and restrict
   the domain and range for each function.
    - The problem with this is that there are multiple models for the same road
      trip.
2. Use a piecewise function to model the road trip.

<u>**Goal:**</u> Create a function **&fnof;** to represent the total distance
_(in miles)_ traveled on my road trip, **_D_**, with respect to the amount of
time _(in hours)_ since I left my brother’s house, **_t_**.

#### Creating Segments Per Portion of the Road Trip

We start by creating a function for each portion of the road trip:

1. **Segment 1:** Average speed of **38** mph for **1.75** hours
    1. **66.5** miles traveled in the first **1.75** hours.
        - _Gotten by multiplying **38** by **1.75**._
    2. Practical domain starts at **[0, 0]** and ends at **[1.75, 0]**.
    3. Practical range starts at **[0, 0]** and ends at **[0, 66.5]**.
    4. The function is **_D_ = &fnof;(_t_) = 38t; 0 &leq; _t_ &leq; 1.75**
       _&larr; Practical domain_
2. **Segment 2:** Average speed of **76** mph for **2.8** hours
    1. **212.8 miles** in the next **2.8** hours.
    2. Practical domain: **1.75 &leq; _t_ &leq; 4.55**
    3. Practical range: **66.5 &leq; _D_ &leq; 279.3**
    4. The function: **D = &fnof;(_t_) = 76(_t_ - 1.75) + 66.5**
        - Created using either the **CROC** or the transformation values.
3. **Segment 3:** Average speed of **8** mph for **0.5** hours
    1. **4** miles in the next **0.5** hours.
    2. Practical domain: **4.55 &leq; _t_ &leq; 5.05**
    3. Practical range: **279.3 &leq; _D_ &leq; 283.3**
    4. The function: **D = &fnof;(_t_) = 8(_t_ - 4.55) + 279.3**

The final segment functions for the road trip are:

> 1. **D = &fnof;(_t_) = 38t; 0 &leq; _t_ &leq; 1.75**
> 2. **D = &fnof;(_t_) = 76(_t_ - 1.75) + 66.5; 1.75 &leq; _t_ &leq; 4.55**
> 3. **D = &fnof;(_t_) = 8(_t_ - 4.55) + 279.3; 4.55 &leq; _t_ &leq; 5.05**

#### Final Piecewise Function

The final piecewise function is:

## How to Create a Piecewise Function

![](assets/piecewise_functions_graphic_001.png)

_Text Version:_

> A **piecewise function** is defined using two or more expressions over given
> intervals of the domain.
>
> The conditions define the input values for which each rule applies. The graphs
> of piecewise functions may be _continuous_ or _discontinuous_. Intuitively,
> a *
*discontinuous function** is one with a "break", "hole", or "jump" in its graph
> and a **continuous function** is one whose graph can be drawn without lifting
> one's pencil.

## Example Problems

1. **&fnof;(3) = 76(3 - 1.75) + 66.5** &rarr; **D = 161.5**
2. **57 = &fnof;(_t_)**
    1. Plug in the value for each rule until you find the correct rule.
    2. For rule 1, it results in **_t_** = **1.5**.
        - This meets the condition for rule 1, so it is the correct rule.
    3. For rule 2, it results in **_t_** = **1.625**.
    4. For rule 3, it does not produce a valid result either.

## Parking Garage Problem

Consider the given table, which shows the fees to park in the East Economy
Garage at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona for a single day.

We see that for any time over **0** minutes through **60 minutes**, the fee is
**$4.00**; for time over **60** through **120 minutes**, the fee is **$8.00**;
and for any time over **120 minutes** (for one day), the fee is **$10.00**.

<u>Table representing the parking garage problem:</u>

| Parking Time<br/>(minutes)<br/>_m_ | Parking Fee<br/>(dollars)<br/>_F_ |
|:-----------------------------------|:---------------------------------:|
| Over 0 through 60                  |             **4.00**              |
| Over 60 through 120                |             **8.00**              |
| Over 120                           |             **10.00**             |

First create functions for all three rules:

1. **F = &fnof;(_m_) = 4; 0 &leq; _m_ &leq; 60**
2. **F = &fnof;(_m_) = 8; 60 &leq; _m_ &leq; 120**
3. **F = &fnof;(_m_) = 10; 120 &leq; _m_**

Then create a piecewise function:

![](assets/piecewise_function_example_002.png)

- <u>**Note: F(_m_) is a single function defined in many _pieces_, not many
  functions.**</u>

## Parking Garage Graph

Graphing the above piecewise function shows that **_F_(_m_)** is a discontinuous
combination of three linear functions.

![](assets/parking_garage_graph.png)

- Use an open circle to denote that a value is not included in the function
- Use an arrow to denote that the function continues beyond the graph.

## Additional Piecewise Function Problems

### Piecewise Function Problem One

![](assets/piecewise_functions_graphic_002.png)

1. Evaluate **&fnof;(-5)**
    1. Use rule 1
    2. **&fnof;(-5) = 2(-5) + 4**
    3. **&fnof;(-5) = -10 + 4**
    4. **&fnof;(-5) = -6**

### Piecewise Function Problem Four

> A 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, and a 26.2-mile run make up an Ironman
> Triathlon competition.
>
> A certain triathlete averages a swimming speed of 2.4 mph, a cycling speed of
> 18 mph, and a running speed of 10 mph.
>
> Assume there is no transitioning time from one segment of the race to another.

- _Source: <www.ironmanarizona.com>_
- Recall that **distance = rate * time**

<u>Goal:</u>

- Develop a piecewise function for the speed, **_S_**, of the participant as
  a function of his time, **_t_**, in hours.

To solve this, we need to understand the speed at any given time within the
race. So we will alter the **distance** formula to get the **time** required to
complete each portion of the race and put the results into a table to better
understand the problem:

| Segment | Distance<br/>(mi) | Rate<br/>(mph) | Time<br/>(hrs) |
|:-------:|:-----------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
|  Swim   |      2.4 mi       |      2.4       |       1        |
|  Bike   |      112 mi       |       18       |      6.22      |
|   Run   |      26.2 mi      |       10       |      2.62      |

- The **Time** section was found by using **time = <sup>distance</sup>
  &frasl;<sub>rate</sub>**

1. <u>Function One</u>
    1. **_S_(_t_) = 2.4; 0 &leq; _t_ &leq; 1**
2. <u>Function Two</u>
    1. **_S_(_t_) = 18; 1 < _t_ &leq; 7.22**
        - It is **7.22** instead of **6.22**, because you need to add the time
          it took to swim to the time it took to bike.
3. <u>Function Three</u>
    1. **_S_(_t_) = 10; 7.22 < _t_ &leq; 9.84**
        - It is **9.84** instead of **2.62**, because you need to add the time
          it took to swim and bike to the time it took to run.

Meaning behind each piece of the piecewise function:

1. **_S_(_t_) = 2.4; 0 &leq; _t_ &leq; 1**

      mph.
2. **_S_(_t_) = 18; 1 < _t_ &leq; 7.22**
    - For the next 6.22 hours, the participant had an average speed of 18 mph
      while biking.
3. **_S_(_t_) = 10; 7.22 < _t_ &leq; 9.84**

## Solving For Functions vs Graphs

### How To Solve For Functions

1. Determine the domain
    - The maximum domain for the current function will serve as both the
      horizontal shift and the minimum domain for the next function.
        - **Example:** If the domain is **-2 &le; _x_ &le; 2**, then the
          horizontal shift for the next function is **2 to the left** and the
          minimum domain for the next function is **-2**.
    - This can usually be found with common sense or within the problem.
      Remember that it should pick up where the maximum domain of the previous
      function left off.
2. Determine the range
    - The maximum range for the current function will serve as both the
      vertical shift and the minimum range for the next function.
        - **Example:** If the range is **-2 &le; _y_ &le; 2**, then the
          vertical shift for the next function is **2 up** and the minimum range
          for the next function is **2**.
    - The range can be determined by plugging in the domain values individually
      into the function.
        - If you already have the minimum range from the previous function, then
          you only need to plug in the maximum value for the next function's
          minimum.
3. Determine the slope
    - You can use the slope formula to find the slope between two points:
      **<sup>y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub></sup> &frasl; <sub>x<sub>2</sub> -
      x<sub>1</sub></sub>**
4. Determine the transformations
    - The horizontal shift is the minimum domain of the current function.
    - The vertical shift is the minimum range of the current function.
5. Determine the final piece of the piecewise function by separating the
   function and domain by a semicolon.
    - **Example:** **&fnof;(_x_) = 2(_x_ - 2) + 2; -2 &lt; _x_ &le; 2**
6. Repeat steps **1-5** until you have found the function for the entire graph.
7. Create the final piecewise function:
    - ![](assets/piecewise_function_example_008.png)

### How To Solve For Graphs

1. Determine the domain
    - You can find this by identifying the beginning and end of where the slope
      changes on the graph.
        - _I.e., The graph is going in a straight line, stops, and then goes in
          a different direction._
    - Make sure to check whether the point is inclusive or exclusive. You will
      usually write each functions minimum to be exclusive besides the very
      first one.
        - **Example:** **-2 &lt; _x_ &le; 2**
2. Determine the range
    - You can find this by identifying the beginning and end of where the slope
      changes on the graph.
        - _I.e., The graph is going in a straight line, stops, and then goes in
          a different direction._
3. Determine the slope
    - You can use the slope formula to find the slope between two points:
      **<sup>y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub></sup> &frasl; <sub>x<sub>2</sub> -
      x<sub>1</sub></sub>**
4. Determine the transformations
    - The horizontal shift is the minimum domain of the current function.
    - The vertical shift is the minimum range of the current function.
    - <u>_Note:</u> You can also visually look at the graph to determine the
      transformations. You will look at how horizontally and vertically shifted
      the beginning point of the line is._
5. Determine the final piece of the piecewise function by separating the
   function and domain by a semicolon.
    - **Example:** **&fnof;(_x_) = 2(_x_ - 2) + 2; -2 &lt; _x_ &le; 2**
6. Repeat steps **1-5** until you have found the function for the entire graph.
7. Create the final piecewise function:
    - ![](assets/piecewise_function_example_008.png)

**Note:** You can create a piecewise function in Desmos by putting the
rules/conditions after the function in bracketed parentheses and separating them
with commas:

> **&fnof;(_x_) = 76(x - 1.75) + 66.5 {1.75 < x &le; 4.55}**

# Module 16 - Function Composition

## Function Composition Activity

<u>The Problem:</u>

> A pebble is thrown into a lake and the radius of the ripple travels outward at
> **2 meters per second**.
>
> Your goal will be to determine the area inside the ripple
> based on the number of seconds elapsed since the pebble hit the water.
>
> - _Note: the formula for finding the area inside a circle is
    > **_A_ = &pi;*r*<sup>2</sup>**_
    >

- *r* is the length of the radius of the circle.

<u>Notes About The Problem:</u>

1. The **radius** and **area** will increase as the time increases.
2. To create a function for the expanding area, you will need to figure out the
   radius at any given time.
    1. You can do this by multiplying the **time** by the **speed**.
    2. The new formulas:
        1. <u>Radius:</u> **_r_ = &fnof;(_t_) = 2*t***
            - **_t_** is the time in seconds.
        2. <u>Area with _Time_ input:</u> **_A_ = &pi;(2*t*)<sup>2</sup>**
        3. <u>Area with _Radius_ Input:</u> **_A_ = &pi;*r*<sup>2</sup>**
3. Plugging in the previous function, to find the radius of the circle after
   three seconds:
    1. **_A_ = &pi;(_3_ &times; 2)<sup>2</sup>**
    2. **_A_ = &pi;(6)<sup>2</sup>**
    3. **_A_ = &pi;(36)**
    4. **_A_ &approx; 113.097 square meters**

## Function Composition Explanation

**Function composition** is when you take the output of one function and use it
as the input for another

- The above problem is an example of function composition.
    - The output of the **radius function** is used as the input for the **area
      function**.

### Writing Function Composition Functions

When an input to a function is itself a function, we write the function output
in place of the variable it defines.

For example, given the following functions from the previous problem:

1. **_r_ = &fnof;(_t_)**
2. **_A_ = _g_(_r_)**

The final function would be written as:

> **_A_ = _g_(_r_) = _g_(&fnof;(_t_))**

![](assets/function_composition_001.png)

- The **_r_** in the **_g_(_r_)** function is replaced with the output of the
  **&fnof;(_t_)** function.
- The **_h_(_t_)** function is the same as the **_g_(_r_)** function.
- All the functions after **_g_** in the image are the same, but the variables
  are different.

Anytime you have a two-step process to find a result, you can model that with a
**composite function**.

- <u>**NOTE:**</u> Function composition only makes sense when the output
  quantity of one function os the input to another.

## Function Composition Examples

### Function Composition Example 1

![](assets/function_composition_example_001.png)

### Function Composition Example 2

The graphs below show two different functions.

1. Function **_g_** takes as its input a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and
   outputs the expected attendance at a neighborhood carnival.
2. Function **_f_** takes as its input the expected attendance at a neighborhood
   carnival and outputs the total expected revenue earned by the carnival.

![](assets/function_composition_example_002.png)

#### Explaining The Meaning

1. Given **&fnof;(_g_(70))**
    1. **70** is the temperate in degrees Fahrenheit.
    2. The output of **_g_(70)** is the expected attendance at the carnival.
        - _**&rarr; 525 expected attendance**_
    3. The output of **&fnof;(525)** is the total expected revenue earned by the
       carnival.
        - _**&rarr; $1,350 total expected revenue**_
    4. <u>**Meaning:**</u> When the temp is **70&deg;F**, the carnival is
       expected to earn
       **$1,350**.
2. Given **_g_(&fnof;(70))**
    1. **70** is the expected attendance at the carnival.
    2. The output of **&fnof;(70)** is the total expected revenue earned by the
       carnival.
        - _**&rarr; $150 total expected revenue**_
    3. The output of **&fnof;** &ne; input of **_g_**.
    4. <u>**Meaning:**</u> There is no meaning, because the input of **_g_** is
       the temperature
       in degrees Fahrenheit and the input of **&fnof;** is the expected
       attendance at the carnival.
3. Given **&fnof;(_g_(_x_)) = 1800**, solve using the graphs for **_x_**.
    1. Write it out: **_x_ &rarr; _g_ &rarr; \_\_\_ &rarr; _f_ &rarr; 1800
       expected revenue**
    2. Work your way backwards.
        1. Looking at the graph, when the expected revenue is **1800**, the
           expected attendance is **700**.
        2. **_x_ &rarr; _g_ &rarr; <u>700</u> &rarr; _f_ &rarr; 1800 expected
           revenue**
        3. Looking at the graph, when the expected attendance is **700**, the
           temperature is **77 degrees Fahrenheit**.
        4. **<u>77</u> &rarr; _g_ &rarr; <u>700</u> &rarr; _f_ &rarr; 1800
           expected revenue**
    3. <u>**Meaning:**</u> When the expected revenue is **$1,800**, the
       temperature is **77 degrees
       Fahrenheit**.

### Function Composition Example 3

Given the following function, where **&fnof;** is the temperate in degrees
Fahrenheit and **_C_** is the temperature in degrees Celsius:

> **&fnof; = _m_(_C_) = <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>C + 32**

1. Determine the formula for the inverse **_m_<sup>-1</sup>(&fnof;)**
    1. Rewrite the formula without the notation
        - &rarr; **&fnof; = <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>C + 32**
    2. Subtract **32** from both sides
        - &rarr; **&fnof; - 32= <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>C**
    3. Multiply both sides by the reciprocal of **<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>
       5</sub>**, which is **<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub>**
        - &rarr; **<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub>(&fnof; - 32) = C**
    4. Rewrite the full notation
        - &rarr; **<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub>(&fnof; - 32) = C = _m_<sup>
          -1</sup>(&fnof;)**
2. Evaluate **_m_(_m_<sup>-1</sup>(115))**
    1. Calculate **_m_<sup>-1</sup>(115)**
        1. **<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub>(115 - 32) = C = _m_<sup>-1</sup>(
           &fnof;)**

#### Solving For Various Function Compositions

1. **&fnof;(&fnof;(3))**
    1. Work your way backwards by finding the inner one first.
    2. Find **&fnof;(3)** in Table 1
        - **3** is the input in this scenario, so look for the corresponding
          output.
        - **&fnof;(3) = -2**
    3. Find **&fnof;(&fnof;(3))**
    4. **&fnof;(&fnof;(3)) = &fnof;(-2) = 0**

5. Given **&fnof;(_g_(_x_)) = 3**, find the value of **_x_**.
    1. For this one, we are looking for the matching input value that will
       produce an output of **3** for **_g_**.
        - _Note: We still work backwards from the inner one._
    2. **_g_(-1) = 3**
    3. **_x_ = 3**
6. **_g_<sup>-1</sup>(3)**
    1. For inverse functions, it's the same as: **_g_(_x_) = 3**
    2. Find the output that makes **_g_(_x_) = 3**
    3. **_g_(-1) = 3**
    4. **_g_<sup>-1</sup>(3) = -1**

#### Function Composition - Problem 5 Question

> A spherical snowball with a radius of **6.4 centimeters**, when brought
> inside, will melt in such a way that its radius decreases by a constant rate
> of
**2 centimeters per minute**.
>
> - The formula for the volume of a sphere as determined by the radius of the
    sphere: **V = <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>&pi;_r_<sup>3</sup>**

<u>Formulas:</u>

- Function **&fnof;** that outputs the radius **_r_** _(measured in
  centimeters)_ with respect to time, **_t_**
    - **_r_ = &fnof;(_t_) = 6.4 - 2*t***
- Function **_g_** that outputs the volume **_V_** of the snowball _(measured in
  cubic centimeters)_ with respect to the radius length of the snowball, **_r_**
  _(in centimeters)_
    - **V = <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>&pi;_r_<sup>3</sup>**
- Function **_h_** that outputs the volume **_V_** of the snowball _(measured in
  cubic centimeters)_ with respect to time, **_t_**
    - **_V_ = _h_(_t_) = _g_(&fnof;(_t_)) = <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>&pi;(
      6.4 - 2*t*)<sup>3</sup>**
- Evaluating **_h_(1.5)** and its meaning
    - **_h_(1.5) = <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>&pi;(6.4 - 2 &times; 1.5)<sup>
      3</sup> = 164.64cm<sup>3</sup>**
    - After **1.5 minutes** since the snowball was brought inside, the volume of
      the snowball is **164.64cm<sup>3</sup>**.

### Function Composition Example 6 - Decomposing Functions

- _Note: There is more than one way to decompose a function._

Below are example functions for **&fnof;(m)** and **m = _g_(_x_)**:

1. **&fnof;(_g_(_x_)) = 3(x - 1) + 5**
    - If **_m_ = _g_(_x_) = x - 1**, then **&fnof;(_m_) = 3*m* + 5**
2. **&fnof;(_g_(_x_)) = (x + 4)<sup>2</sup>**
    - If **_m_ = _g_(_x_) = x + 4**, then **&fnof;(_m_) = _m_<sup>2</sup>**
3. **&fnof;(_g_(_x_)) = (x + 2)<sup>2</sup> + 3(x + 2) + 1**
    - If **_m_ = _g_(_x_) = x + 2**, then **&fnof;(_m_) = _m_<sup>2</sup> +
      3*m* + 1**
4. **&fnof;(_g_(_x_)) =
   &radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">&nbsp;x - 1&nbsp;</span>**
    - If **_m_ = _g_(_x_) = x - 1**, then **&fnof;(_m_) =
      &radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">&nbsp;_m_&nbsp;</span>**
5. **&fnof;(_g_(_x_)) = <sup>500</sup>&frasl;<sub>100 - x<sup>2</sup></sub>**
    - If **_m_ = _g_(_x_) = 100 - x<sup>2</sup>**, then **&fnof;(_m_) = <sup>
      500</sup>&frasl;<sub>_m_</sub>**

## Systems of Equations

- A systems of equations is a group of two or more equations.
- To solve for a system of equations, you must find the values of the variables
  that make all of the equations true.
- Some methods for solving systems of equations:
    - **The Substitution Method**
    - **The Elimination Method**
    - **The Graphical Method**

### Systems of Equations - Example 1

> You just rented a new apartment and need to move your belongings from the old
> apartment to the new one. You contact two rental companies and receive the
> following information for the one-day cost of renting a moving van:
>
> - _Company A_: **$39.95 per day**, plus **$0.59 per mile**
> - _Company B_: **$59.95 per day**, plus **$0.22 per mile**

<u>Formulas:</u>

- _Company A_: **_y_ = 39.95 + 0.59*x***
- _Company B_: **_y_ = 59.95 + 0.22*x***

<u>Graph:</u>

![](assets/systems_of_equations_graph_001.png)

<u>Solution:</u>

The point at which both equations will cost the same _(making both equations
true)_ is at **(x, y) = (54.054, 71.842)**.

- If you're driving less than **54.054 miles**, then **Company A** is cheaper.
- If you're driving more than **54.054 miles**, then **Company B** is cheaper.

### Systems of Equations - Example 2

Given two functions:

- **y = 3*x* - 4**
- **y = -*x* + 28**

<u>Solution:</u>

1. Solve for **x**.
    1. Use substitution method since both equations are already solved for **y
       **.
    2. **3*x* - 4 = -*x* + 28**
    3. **3*x* = -*x* + 32**
    4. **4*x* = 32**
    5. **x = 8**
2. Solve for **y**
    1. Plug in **x = 8** into either equation.
    2. **y = 3*x* - 4**
    3. **y = 3(8) - 4**
    4. **y = 24 - 4**
    5. **y = 20**
3. Check your solution of **(8, 20)** by plugging both values into both
   equations to ensure they are both accurate.
    1. **y = 3*x* - 4**
        1. **20 = 3(8) - 4**
        2. **20 = 24 - 4**
        3. **20 = 20**
    2. **y = -*x* + 28**
        1. **20 = -8 + 28**
        2. **20 = 20**

### Systems of Equations - Example 3

Given two linear equations:

- **y = 3*x* + 1**
- **_x_ + 4*y* = 30**

<u>Solution:</u>

1. Solve for **x** using substitution
    1. _Equation 1_ **y = 3*x* + 1** &rarr; _Equation 2_ **_x_ + 4*y* = 30**
    2. **_x_ + 4(3*x* + 1) = 30**
    3. **_x_ + 12*x* + 4 = 30**
    4. **13*x* + 4 = 30**
    5. **13*x* = 26**
    6. **x = 2**
2. Solve for **y** using substitution
    1. **y = 3*x* + 1**
    2. **y = 3(2) + 1**
    3. **y = 6 + 1**
    4. **y = 7**
3. Check your solution of **(2, 7)** by plugging both values into both equations
   to ensure they are both accurate.
    1. **y = 3*x* + 1**
        1. **7 = 3(2) + 1**
        2. **7 = 6 + 1**
        3. **7 = 7**
    2. **_x_ + 4*y* = 30**
        1. **2 + 4(7) = 30**
        2. **2 + 28 = 30**
        3. **30 = 30**

### Systems of Equations - Example 4

> Rashid works as a driver for both Lyft and Uber. After expenses such
> as insurance, taxes, and gas are taken out of his pay, he makes about <u>**$20
> every hour for Lyft**</u> and about <u>**$18 every hour for Uber**</u>.
>
> - **L = number of hours worked for Lyft**
> - **U = number of hours worked for Uber**
>
> The following equations are true:
>
> - **3L = U**
> - **20L + 18U = 370**

<u>Solution:</u>

- <u>**Meanings**</u>
    - **3L = U**
        - For every **3 hours worked for Lyft**, Rashid works **1 hour for
          Uber**.
    - **20L + 18U = 370**
        - After working for both Lyft and Uber, Rashid makes **$370**.
        - **20L**
            - **20 dollars per hour pay &times; The amount of hours worked =
              Total money made working at Lyft**
        - **18U**
            - **18 dollars per hour pay &times; The amount of hours worked =
              Total money made working at Uber**
- <u>**Solve for L**</u>
    1. Because **3L = U**, we can substitute **U** for **3L** in the second
       equation.
    2. **20L + 18(3L) = 370**
    3. **20L + 54L = 370**
    4. **74L = 370**
    5. **L = 5**
- <u>**Solve for U**</u>
    1. **3L = U**
    2. **3(5) = U**
    3. **15 = U**
- <u>**Verify Solutions**</u>
    1. **3L = U**
        1. **3(5) = 15**
        2. **15 = 15**
    2. **20L + 18U = 370**
        1. **20(5) + 18(15) = 370**
        2. **100 + 270 = 370**
        3. **370 = 370**
- <u>Final Solution:</u>
    - **L = 5 hours**
    - **U = 15 hours**

    **three bags of chips**.
> - **Dale paid $20** (before tax) and bought **four 2-liters** and **4 bags
    of chips**.
>
> _Note: Assume that they each paid the same price per item._


<u>Variables:</u>

- **C = price of bag of chips**
- **S = price of 2-liter of soda**

<u>Equations:</u>

- **4S + 3C = 18**
- **4S + 4C = 20**

<u>Solution:</u>

1. Use the elimination method to solve for **C**, coefficients are the same for
   enough of the variables to leave only one left.
    1. Flip one of the equations to negative.
        - <u>_Equation 1:_</u> **-4S - 3C = -18**
        - <u>_Equation 2:_</u> **4S + 4C = 20**
    2. Add the equations together by combining like terms.
    3. **(-4S + 4S) + (-3C + 4C) = (-18 + 20)**
    4. **C = 2**
2. Solve for **S** by plugging in **C** into either equation.
    1. **4S + 3C = 18**
    2. **4S + 3(2) = 18**
    3. **4S + 6 = 18**
    4. **4S = 12**
    5. **S = 3**
3. Check your solution of **(2, 3)** by plugging both values into both
   equations to ensure they are both accurate.
    1. **4S + 3C = 18**
        1. **4(3) + 3(2) = 18**
        2. **12 + 6 = 18**
        3. **18 = 18**
    2. **4S + 4C = 20**
        1. **4(3) + 4(2) = 20**
        2. **12 + 8 = 20**
        3. **20 = 20**
4. <u>Final Solution:</u>
