## Function Transformations

The function **_g_(x) = a&fnof;(x-c) + d** is a transformed function in terms of
the parent function **&fnof;(x)**.

The parameters **a**, **c**, and **d**
transform the function in the following ways:

| Parameter | Transformation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Identify the Transformations

### Identify Transformation One

Given the parent function is **&fnof;(x)**, the transformations used to create
the transformed function **_g_(x)** are:

> **_g_(x) = -2&fnof;(x) + 3**

- Vertical reflection
- Vertical stretch by a factor of 2
- Vertical shift up 3 units

Suppose that **&fnof;(x) = 2&radic;x - 1**. The formula in terms of **_x_**
for each of the functions is:

1. **_g_(x) = -2&fnof;(x) + 3**
2. **_g_(x) = -2(2&radic;x - 1) + 3**
    - You could leave it like this, but it's better to follow the rest of the
      steps for readability.
3. **_g_(x) = -4&radic;x +2 + 3**
4. **_g_(x) = -4&radic;x + 5**

### Identify Transformation Two

Given the parent function is **&fnof;(x)**, the transformations used to create
the transformed function **_k_(x)** are:

> **_k_(x) = 0.5&fnof;(x - 4)**

- Vertical compression by a factor of 0.5
- Horizontal shift to the right 4 units

Suppose that **&fnof;(x) = 2&radic;x - 1**. The formula in terms of **_x_**
for each of the functions is:

1. **_k_(x) = 0.5&fnof;(x - 4)**
2. **_k_(x) = 0.5(2&radic;(x - 4) - 1)**
    - The equation becomes **x - 4** inside the radical, because the input for
      **&fnof;** is **x - 4**, not just **x**.
    - The radical sign goes above both the **x** and the **4**, hence the
      parentheses.
3. **_k_(x) = 1&radic;(x - 4) - 0.5**
4. **_k_(x) = &radic;(x - 4) - 0.5**

### Identify Transformation Three

Given the parent function is **&fnof;(x)**, the transformations used to create
the transformed function **_j_(x)** are:

> **_j_(x) = -4&fnof;(-x) - 0.5**

- Vertical reflection
- Vertical stretch by a factor of 4
- Horizontal reflection
- Vertical shift down 0.5 units

Suppose that **&fnof;(x) = 2&radic;x - 1**. The formula in terms of **_x_**
for each of the functions is:

1. **_j_(x) = -4(&fnof;(-x) - 0.5)**
2. **_j_(x) = -4(2&radic;-x - 1) - 0.5**
3. **_j_(x) = -8&radic;-x + 4 - 0.5**
4. **_j_(x) = -8&radic;-x + 3.5**

## Identify Graph Transformations

### Identify Graph Transformation One

Suppose we were given the graph of the parent function **&fnof;** and asked to
graph the transformed function:

> **g(x) = 2&fnof;(x â€” 1)**

<u>The graph:</u>

![](assets/function_transformations_004.png)

- The graph was shifted to the right 1 unit, and stretched vertically by a
  factor of 2.
    - The **x** inputs were shifted to the right 1 unit.
    - The **y** outputs were stretched vertically by a factor of 2.

---

### Identify Graph Transformation Two

Suppose we were given the graph of the parent function **_r_** (in red) and the
transformed function **_b_** (in blue) and asked to identify the
transformations:

![](assets/function_transformations_005.png)

<u>Based on the graph, the formula of **_b_** in terms of **_r_** is:</u>

> **_b_(x) = r(x + 3) + 1**

To identify the transformations:

- **Vertical stretch or compression**
    1. Look for a change in outputs from on set of coordinates to the next on
       both graphs. If the parent function increases by 1 unit on both the _x_
       and _y_ axes, but the transformed function increases by more than 1 unit,
       there is either a stretch or compression.
- **Horizontal shift**
    1. Look for how far the transformed function is shifted horizontally from
       the parent function.
- **Vertical shift**
    1. Look for how far the transformed function is shifted vertically from the
       parent function.
- **Vertical reflection**
    1. Look for a change in the vertical direction of the graph.
    2. If the parent function is going one way vertically and the transformed
       function is vertically going the opposite way, there is a vertical
       reflection.
- **Horizontal reflection**
    1. Look for a change in the horizontal direction of the graph.
    2. If the parent function is going one way horizontally and the transformed
       function is horizontally going the opposite way, there is a horizontal
       reflection.

---

### Identify Graph Transformation Three

Suppose we were given the graph of the parent function **_r_** (in red) and the
transformed function **_b_** (in blue) and asked to identify the
transformations:

![](assets/function_transformations_006.png)

<u>Based on the graph, the formula of **_b_** in terms of **_r_** is:</u>

> **_b_(x) = 3r(x + 4)**

To identify the transformations:

- **Vertical stretch**
    1. The parent function increases by 1 unit on both the _x_ and _y_ axes, but
       the transformed function increases by 3 units on the _y_-axis and 1 unit
       on the _x_-axis.
    2. The increase in the transformed function is **3** times more than the
       increase in the parent function.
    3. The parent function starts at **(0, 1)**, but if it were stretched by
       a factor of **3**, then the transformed function would start at **(0, 3)
       **.
        - You can make sure that the predicted stretch is correct by either
          drawing out the graph or by checking the other points and making sure
          that they all align with what the y-values should be. _Use a table if
          necessary_.
    4. It's being stretched by a factor of **3**.
    5. It's also helpful to draw out the stretched graph to make sure that it
       matches the transformed graph.
- **Horizontal shift**
    1. The transformed function is shifted to the left by **4** units.

### Identify Graph Transformation Four

Suppose we were given the graph of the parent function **_r_** (in red) and the
transformed function **_b_** (in blue) and asked to identify the
transformations:

![](assets/function_transformations_007.png)

<u>Based on the graph, the formula of **_b_** in terms of **_r_** is:</u>

> **_b_(x) = -2r(x) + 2**

To identify the transformations:

- **Vertical reflection**
    1. The parent function is going one way vertically and the transformed
       function is vertically going the opposite way, there is a vertical
       reflection.
- **Vertical stretch**
    1. The transformed function decreases at twice the amount of the parent
       function.
- **Vertical shift**
    1. The transformed function is shifted up by **2** units.

## Horizontal Reflections

Suppose that the transformed function **_g_(x)** is:

> **_g_(x) = &fnof;(-x)**

Now suppose that the parent function **&fnof;** is:

> **&fnof;(x) = 4x - 5**

<u>The Result:</u>
